The robe opens down the front and is secured by five spherical brass buttons that fit through corresponding loops; the buttons begin at the neck and continue down to the waist.  The black silk of the robe is woven with openwork roundels depicting pairs of dragons chasing flaming pearls amid cloud and scrolling lotus designs.  There is a so-called Mandarin square, or badge of rank, on the front of the robe and an identical one on the back, indicating that this was the robe of a government official.  The embroidered squares depict a white bird with a long, plumed tail, and with wings spread in flight, ascending toward teh red disk of the sun in the upper left of the composition; the scene is set against a patterned ground that suggests rocks and waves at the bottom, clouds at the top, a pine at the left, and bamboo at the right.  The patterned ground was probably machine produced.  The brid and the sun disk were produced separately and stiched onto the patterned ground, indicative of late nineteenth or early twentieth-century workmanship, as earlier Mandarin squares tend to have the complete design integrally embroidered.  The sheer fabric and the lack of a lining indicate that the robe was for use in the summer.","medium":"Black silk with mandarin squares embroidered in brightly colored silk threads","lendingpermissionlevel":0,"title":"Short Summer Robe with Mandarin Squares on the Front and Back","accessionmethod":"Gift","provenance":"Mrs. Simon Kuznets purchased at an antique store in Beijing (Summer 1946).","groupcount":0,"dated":"late 19th-early 20th century","department":"Department of Asian Art","dateend":1925,"url":"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/201683","dateoffirstpageview":"2011-11-19","century":"19th-20th century","objectnumber":"1991.99","labeltext":null,"datebegin":1875,"culture":"Chinese","exhibitioncount":0,"imagepermissionlevel":0,"mediacount":0,"objectid":201683,"techniqueid":null,"dimensions":"H. 112.4 x W.
